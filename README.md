# Dead Light Green Light - Plutonium T6 Zombies - 1.0
This is a recreation of the Black Ops 6 Limited Time Mode called Dead Light Green Light, but better.
Its basically Red Light Green Light but with a twist!

I felt like the original mode was lacking some proper punishments for when you move AND it was stupid that EEs were disabled and there was a round limit of 10.
This allows EEs and doesn't have a round limit.

On Green Light, you can move and you get double points.
On Red Light, you have to stand still and you do not gain points. If you move, you get punished!
At a random point, Dead Light will activate, where you can move but zombies will have super sprint.

By Default, there is no perk limit.

## Installation
Download deadlight_greenlight.gsc and put it in your Plutonium T6 scripts folder

```%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\zm\```

(if the folder isnt there create them)

You will have to open console and type in ```set enable_deadlightgreenlight 1``` to enable this! This is so you can still have the script in your folder while also able to disable it if you want to use other mods!

There is one configurable option!

``set deadlight_rules 0/1/2`` - Choose whether or not you wanna use the improved rules or the rules from Black Ops 6.
- 0 - The Improved Rules. Basically allows the punishments.
- 1 - Bo6's rules. Doesn't include punishments.
- 2 - Squid Game's rules. Instead of losing points or getting punish, you get downed.
